# Laravel API boilerplate üöÄ

An awesome boilerplate for your next Laravel 9 based API. It's only goal is to simply **kick-start your API development** and provide you with some of the best practices when building amazing and scalable REST APIs üî•

## Features
<dl>
<dt>REST API Best Practices</dt>
<dd>We baked in all the best REST API practices in terms of structuring your API, naming conversations, HTTP methods, responses and optimizations</dd>
	
<dt>Concrete examples</dt>
<dd>We all like to learn by examples and that's why  the boilerplate comes with a concrete example that include everything from folder structure, routes to naming controllers</dd>

<dt>Scaffolding Artisan command</dt>
<dd>Tired of manually creating controllers, resources, test and form requests each time for new API endpoints. We were too. That's why we added a command that does all of that for you. Just run `php artisan treblle:make` and you get everything you need in a second</dd>

<dt>Built-in versioning</dt>
<dd>Building a versioning system that scales is always hard and that's why we built in a robust versioning system that is easy to use and can grow with the project</dd>

<dt>Single responsibility controllers</dt>
<dd>The boilerplate uses single responsibility controllers that make it painfully obvious what's going on and can be used with different versions</dd>

<dt>Models, migrations and factories</dt>
<dd>We built two tables Users and Posts and defined everything you might need on a database and model level</dd>

<dt>Sanctum authentication</dt>
<dd>Built in Laravel Sanctum authentication included in the boilerplate.</dd>

<dt>Magical UUID trait</dt>
<dd>Want to use UUIDs but find it to much work just use our built in `InteractsWithUuid` trait and have fun with UUIDs</dd>

<dt>Spawn a new user quickly</dt>
<dd>Easily create a new user without messing around with database clients or CRUD systems by using our custom command `php artisan user:create`</dd>

<dt>Treblle included</dt>
<dd>We added an awesome Laravel package called Treblle. Out of the box Treblle gives you: real-time API monitoring, automatically generated and updated documentation, error tracking and logging, API analytics, quality scoring and much more. To get started with Treblle just run `php artisan treblle:start` and follow the instructions or visit [treblle.com](https://treblle.com) for more information</dd>
